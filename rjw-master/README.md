OwO what's this?  
RimjobWorld is a sex mod that overhauls Rimworld loving, mating and pregnancy mechanics.  
Mod supports various sex/hentai fetishes.  
Mod is highly configurable and most feature turned off by default, so you can go from vanilla experience to your wild fantasies.  
Many additional features(submods) can be found on LL forum and discord.
