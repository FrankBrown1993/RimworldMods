## v0.7.1

- Minor code changes.

## v0.7.0

- Overhauled stretching calculation to take into account multiple penetrators and extended RJW values (i.e. length and girth).
- Difficulty of extreme stretching has increased; extremely overstretched orifices can take up to 4 days to restore.
- Prolapse and damage are no longer chance based but size-based.
- Damage caused to stretched orifices has increased in severity, meaning that a number of stretching penetrations can destroy an orifice.
- New Hediff added: "CervixPunch".
- Added option to violate thermodynamics when transferring nutrition (i.e. pawns can transfer nutrition even if they themselves have none left).
- When cumflation is enabled, too much anal cumflation will overflow into the stomach, and too much overflow from the stomach will induce vomiting.
- Settings have been cleaned up; old settings file will error out.

- Changed stretching from random rolls to size comparison.
- Permanent stretching = pp 150% > orifice
- Temp stretching = pp > orifice
- Changed cuminflation to use real ejaculation value
- Fixed genital growing serums

## v0.5c - Sk√∂mer

- Growth/reduction rework: serums add/remove 10% size on a scale where "huge" is 90%, so you may need multiple serums to go a rjw size up (from average to big for example). Stretching  uses the same system.
- Inflation calculations have been reworked. Inflation multiplier slider can be set to up to 20x.
- You'll need rjw race support mod for the futa/genderbend/reverter to work as intended if you use alien races.
