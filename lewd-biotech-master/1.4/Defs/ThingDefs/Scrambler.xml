    <description>A slaver implant, made from a modified mindscrew, that can inject disorienting mind imagery directly into the visual cortex of the brain through a complex network of nanoelectrodes. Victims of scrambler implantation tend to socially withdraw to minimize additional stimulation. As a consequence of their confusion, they also become physically meek, making them easy to impose upon. Allies of implanted victims will be angered.</description>
