This mod makes people a little more conscious about whether their underwear is showing. How people feel about their current state of dress can be modified using the Underwear precept included in this mod - exhibitionists do like to show off their underwear, however!

This mod does not add any new apparel. You will require either Underwhere mod and/or S16's extension mod to benefit from this mod - the the scantier underwear from these mods have also been modified so that they only cover / protect the genitals and chest instead of the legs and torso.
