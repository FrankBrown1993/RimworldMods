ShirtButton has full variation of boobed apparel texture.
It's easy to draw with an additional layer from ShirtBotton's texture



others have some missing boob size :

if correct texture doesn't exist, it tries to find bigger one.
for example:
1. make micro, average, huge boob texture only
2. pawn who has large breast.
3. system tries to find large breasts texture but doesn't exist
4. then system tries to find bigger one(large->huge)
5. huge texture exist.
6. apparel is changed to huge boob texture.
